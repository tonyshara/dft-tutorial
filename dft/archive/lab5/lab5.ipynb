    "### Motivation: Signal Restoration\n",
    "\n",
    "*Degradation* (also referred to as *distortion*) is a common problem in signal and image processing: you want access to a \"ground truth\" signal $x(n)$, but due to some real-world physical constraints, you can only observe $y(n)$, a corrupted version of $x(n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you're playing a song $x(n)$ in a large concert hall. Due to the acoustics of the room, your audience hears $y(n)$, the song superimposed with a quieter echo of it (that is, $x(n)$ plus a delayed and attenuated copy of $x(n)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we address how to compensate for signal distortions. Our goal is to produce $\\hat{x}(n)$, an estimate of the original signal $x(n)$, using the measured signal $y(n)$. The process of determining $\\hat{x}(n)$ using $y(n)$ is called *signal restoration*."

    "### Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "From a block-diagram perspective, we can think of this *degradation* as a *system* $H$, which outputs $y(n)$, our measured signal, from input $x(n)$, the true signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/degrade.png\" width=\"700px\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our job is to design a *restoration system*, $R$, that attempts to undo the effects of $H$ to give us $\\hat{x}(n)$, a nice approximation of $x(n)$. Using the concert hall example from above, $H$ could be the acoustics of the room, and $R$ could be a specialized filter chip in a de-echoing concert microphone you bought from your local microphone dealer."

    "### Designing $R$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $H$ could be *any* system (e.g., nonlinear, time-varying, etc.), and undoing it may be intractable. To simplify things, we'll assume: \n",
    "- $H$, the degradation system, y\n",
    "is DT-LTI (with frequency response $H(\\omega)$ and impulse response $h(n)$).\n",
    "- $R$, the recovery system we choose, is DT-LTI (with frequency response $R(\\omega)$ and impulse response $r(n)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's not obvious, in many scenarios of practical interest (e.g. acoustic echoes, system lag, image blur), this simplified model where we force ourselves to think of everything as LTI is not too far from the real-life system behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $H$ is LTI, we can describe it's behaviour as a convolution, $y(n) = (x * h)(n)$. We want to design $R$ to *undo* this convolution, performing what's called ***deconvolution***. For this problem it's easier to work in the frequency domain, where our time-signal convolution just becomes frequency-response multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y(\\omega) = H(\\omega) X(\\omega),$$\n",
    "\n",

    "This approach has two main issues:\n",
    "1. $H$ may be zero at some frequency $\\omega_0$, in which case the division is not well-defined. Intuitively, all content at $\\omega_0$ is killed, and we're left with no information about it, so we can't invert the behavior.\n",
    "2. Even if $H$ is nonzero over all frequencies, it's often very small, and so $1 / H(\\omega)$ will be huge, and amplify noise that will be present in practical setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these issues, it's more common to use *Wiener filtering* in practice for deconvolution. Wiener filtering is a more sophisticated technique that uses statistical properties of the signals and noise involved to produce better results. However, Wiener filtering and Fourier deconvolution are similar in spirit (and we don't want to go down a rabbit hole into statistical signal processing), so we'll be using Fourier in this lab.\n",

We can now, by a convention of the imaging world, start building our image by taking the first $W$ elements of our 1D signal and inserting them as the top row of the image matrix, the next $W$ elements of our signal become the second row of the matrix, and so on until we've ran out of both samples and space in the matrix; the process visually looks something like this:\n",

This is because if we rounded the floating point data to its nearest integer representation, and saved it as a .tiff image file, that change would alone be enough that our deconvolution algorithm would never converge on an optimal solution (the error would always be massive, even for the \"correct\" gaussian kernel parameters)."
